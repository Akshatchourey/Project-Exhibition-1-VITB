### Problem Statement:
The problem of overspending is generally faced by college students 
resulting in their empty bank accounts and even finding it difficult to track 
their spending(how much they have spent on what). This overspending problem 
is further increased after the launch of digital payment systems like UPI.

### Overspending:
Overspending is the act of spending more money than one can afford. 
It results in empty bank accounts. Not knowing where you have spent.
Can affect your physical and mental health, it is very important to find the solution.

### Conclusion:
Any student using this application can tell how much they have 
spent in 4 years of their college journey.
